# WinterGUIProject
Here is a winter project I did with a couple friends using Java. The project revolved around the theme of the holidays and includes an interface that accesses a Video, Website, Animation, and Slideshow. 
In order to run the project, please download all files and place them all in the same directory. You will have to change the location of the files within the code after you download. Thank you!
